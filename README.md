# Diamond-price-prediction Models


# Overview:
This project predicts diamond prices based on characteristics like carat, clarity, and color. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

Objectives:

Clean and prepare data (e.g., handle missing values).
Analyze data to find patterns and correlations.
Build and evaluate multiple regression models.
Models Used:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression
Key Insights:

Carat weight significantly impacts diamond prices.
Regularization improved model performance by reducing overfitting.
Next Steps:

Further tune model parameters for accuracy.
Test advanced algorithms, like Gradient Boosting, to improve predictions.
